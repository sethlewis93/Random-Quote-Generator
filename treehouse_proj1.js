Build a collection of quotations — these are the quotes, author and other information that gets printed to the screen. 
You'll do this by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects — one object for each quotation.
Create a function that pulls one of those quotes out at random.
Create a function that prints that quote to the screen.
